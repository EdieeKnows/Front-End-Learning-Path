		<!-- you can use CSS(casading style sheets) in the html to change looking of different elements

		<p style="color:blue; font-size:large">
			Hello world!(large)
		</p>
		<p style="color:red; font-size:small">
			Hello world!(small)
		</p>

		<!-- but generally we prefer to write CSS in another file and load it in the html page. The reason
				we want to do this is not just reuse the CSS to different elements, but also your browser will 
				have the copy of CSS file and update in a period of time which will speedup your page laoding.-->
		<p class="blueLarge">
			Hello world!(large)
		</p>
		<p class="redSmall">
			Hello world!(small)

		<!-- you can also just write your style in the head of the html file. -->
		<p class="pinkLarger">
			This style define in the head of html file.

		<!-- selectors are some conditions you want to apply to elements which are going to affected by your CSS -->
		<span>This line is not black because it is styled by universal selector.</span>

		<br />

		This
		<!-- there are also tag selectors by which you can apply your style to all curtain elements, 
					e.g. here we have achor been styled  -->
		<a href="https://www.google.com">google</a>
		is 200% size.

		<p>
			Here we used a id selector to make your <span id="myName">Name XYZ</span> a bit different from other text.
		</p>

		<!-- you can use your attribute selectors to make elements with curtain attributes to be styled -->
		<form>
			<p>
				Here we have two radio buttons and a text input button. We want our radio buttons to be bigger.
				but we don't want our text input button change. We can use the attribute selector to do the job.
			</p>
			<input name="a button" type="radio" />
			<br />
			<input name="a button" type="radio" />
			<br />
			<input type="text" class="text-field" value="type here" disabled />
		</form>

		<!-- Here is some combinators examples. -->
		<div class="A">
			<span class="B">This is first B</span>
			<span class="C">This is first C</span>
			<span class="B">This is second B</span>
			<span class="B">This is third B</span>
			<div>
				<span class="B">This is a B nested in A div.</span>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			You can use Pseudo class to select specific area of a element.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example every first letter of paragraph is bigger now.
